title = "Functional Programming Fundamentals Talk"
+++

In February 2016, I gave a talk at [Red Badger](https://red-badger.com/)'s [Functional Programming for the Web](http://www.meetup.com/Functional-Programming-for-the-Web/) meetup in London, on the topic of "Functional Programming Fundamentals". 

The talk explains topics such as first class functions, composition, currying, functors and monads in a (hopefully!) simple way for newcomers to FP, illustrated using JavaScript examples which are available on [GitHub](http://bit.ly/FPFundamentalsCode), as are the [slides](http://bit.ly/FPFundementals).

The talk was inspired by [Dr. Boolean](https://twitter.com/drboolean)'s excellent free e-book, [Professor Frisby's Mostly Adequate Guide to Functional Programming](https://github.com/MostlyAdequate/mostly-adequate-guide).
