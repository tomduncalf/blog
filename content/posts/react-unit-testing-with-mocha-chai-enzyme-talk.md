title = "Unit Testing React Applications with Mocha, Chai and Enzyme Talk"
+++

In April 2016, I gave a talk at [Red Badger](https://red-badger.com/)'s [React London User Group](http://www.meetup.com/London-React-User-Group/) meetup in London, on the topic of "Unit Testing React Applications with Mocha, Chai and Enzyme". 

The talk introduces the fundamentals of testing a React application with AirBnB's excellent [Enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme) library, and explains my approach to both unit and integration testing apps using the combination of [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/), [Chai](http://chaijs.com/) and [Enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme).

Both the [code samples](http://bit.ly/ReactTestingCode), and the [slides](http://bit.ly/ReactTestingPresentation) are available on GitHub.

You can watch the talk on [YouTube](http://bit.ly/ReactTestingTalk) or below:
